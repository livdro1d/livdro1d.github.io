<h1>A White Christmas in Tartarus</h1>
<h3> A Hot Christmas Eve in Hell</h3>
<p>It was the night before Christmas. And all through the hotel, not a mortal was moving, same could not be said for the immortals in hell. For a plan had been crafted, one that took a lot of might. Causing even the creatures in hell to feel both fear and a little delight. Hades had always loved Christmas and yearned for the feeling of snow. But having a cold day in Hell had far less of a chance than the Grinch's heart to grow. But alas, Hades thought, and tinkered, and wondered till at last he came across a place whose cold he could plunder. A place that knew heat almost as much as himself. A place where people could survive a longer heat spell. A land known as Florida, hanging off near the shores. It was the key to Hell's first white Christmas and many many more. Hades and his crew worked all night, with no sign of stopping. While many onlookers paused and placed bets on when they would start dropping. Hours passed and finally <a href="page2.html"> his creation was complete.</a>  </p>
<h3> A Hot Christmas in Florida</h3>
<p>And little did I know that my Christmas was just about to be ruined as I sat in my hotel suite. Wrapping last minute gifts, excited for tomorrow. Only to end up wishing I had just gone to Colorado. Christmas day arrived at last! Finally, the day was here that made it worth experiencing all 359 days past. The weather forecast told of a crisp and cool Christmas day. With a slight chance for some snow play. As I ran outside, I was ready to feel the brisk chill hitting my face. Instead, I was met with a rather uncomfortable warm embrace. The sun beamed and glared as it looked down upon me. Almost as to say, “You should know in Florida the weather is never guaranteed.” But what happened next, will forever live on as the most shocking thing in history. </p>
