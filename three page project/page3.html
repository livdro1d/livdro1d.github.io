<h1>A Christmas Like No Other</h1>
<h3>An Unpredictable Forecast</h3>
<p>The world was changed forever that day. Floridians might have been the target of a heatwave, but no one was prepared for the words of The Weather Girls to come true. The news spread fast across the globe, one by one men started raining down in Florida. The cause unknown, and a ghastly sight to behold. Most would not make it, but the very few who were spared by the unlikliest of cushions would go on to tell the tale of how Hades ruined Christmas.</p>
<h3>There's No Place Like Hell for the Holidays </h3>
<p>Hades was awoken early Christmas morning by a slight chill coming from his window. He immeditaley jumped out of bed, and put on his best winter wear. He did not have any, so best he could do was his longest gown and weather boots. He ran outside and dove into the snow. Making snow angels and snowman all day long. The immortals in hell looked on in folly, but even they could not resist the greatest snowball fight in all of creation. This day would live on in history, with people even vacationing below because, "There's no place like Hell for the holidays!"  </p>
