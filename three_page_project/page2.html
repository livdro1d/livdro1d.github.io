<h1>The Making of the Machine</h1>
<h3> The Windsock with A Twist</h3>
<p>Hades, which not many people knew, considered himself to be an expert meterolgist.That if Hell had seaons, he would deliver the weather with a gusto never seen before. Something that would even leave Jim Cantore shaking in his weather boots. With his knowledge of the field, he constcruted a windsock, but with a twist. Instead of tiny tunnel like flag, the windsock would stretch across the whole space of Florida and suck out all the cool air down to hell. Some patent pending expert vacuuming technology.</p>
<h3>Forging in Fire</h3>
<p>Hades with plan in mind, and drawings in hand switflty left to speak with the most esteemed metal workers in all of creation. He took them all one by one below with a promise that they will never come here again, if they help him with his machine. Some complained, "But why on Christmas Eve?" Hades grinned, and said, "I fancy myself like the Grinch. Instead of love warming my heart and making it grow, I long for the cold to shrivel and shrink all that is below." The workers perplexed, but nonetheless continued working. With fear and adrenaline pushing them hard, they worked till they could work no more. With the job completed, Hades kept his word. He returned the workers home, swearing to never see them again. Only thing is, the workers did not know that they also signed up as test dummies for his machine. The song <a href="page3.html">"It's Raining Men"</a>will never be looked at the same again.</p>
