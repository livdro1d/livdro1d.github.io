<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: larger;">This project is about my mind, body, and spirit; that I made by collaging found images from the internet on photoshop. Throughout each piece I wanted it to be very bright and colorful because I feel that inside I have a brighter expressive personality. In the mind piece specifically, I chose to have this starkly bright figure surrounded by these dark blue-gray tones to reflect that. I am a very easily overwhelmed person, that constantly feels pulled in many different directions; be it from people or things. In the body piece, I wanted to show my growing acceptance with my physical self. As well as taking away the mega importance placed on it because it is only my physical form. Throughout the hair and the body, you will see curved figures and bits of shows or movies that I felt impacted my personality. Because these are bits of me that are stored in this form. While my body is me, it is not fully me. There is so much more than can meet the eye. I want people to look a bit deeper, then look even deeper. For the spirit piece, I really wanted to encapsulate this ‘spiritual journey of acceptance’ I am trying to undertake. It takes the bits of the mind and the body and says, you are a free being who has the power to roam wherever and do whatever. I believe that I can do so much more by become more in tune with the mental, the physical, and spiritual aspects of myself. Upon completing this project, I believe I have taken many more steps in that direction.
