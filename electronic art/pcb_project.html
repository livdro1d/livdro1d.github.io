<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: larger;"> This project was the most horrifying one. It was my first time ever soldering, and I was really worried. We had to build this little board and if we did it correctly, then the light would go on and off using the sensor to note the change in the enviroment. It took me two attempts, but the second one made me more confident. Even though I did have a small spark incident, but thankfully no fires happened.
