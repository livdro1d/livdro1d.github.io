 <div style="position: absolute; margin-top: 1600px;"> <p>Note to Prof. Asmuth: I want to add some images where these color blocks are, but cannot get them to place how I want them to. How should I go about doing that? You can check my demos where you will find the practice index page. Thats some of the code I found online, but it is not working how I need it to. Until then, enjoy this easter theme.</p></div>
